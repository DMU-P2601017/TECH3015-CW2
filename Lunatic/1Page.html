    top right corner. It was achieved by uploading the "img" element and giving the image a specific
    function "onclick". This "onclick" event evokes a function to open the id "BackpackPopup" or close
    it later when tapping the button "CLOSE THE BACKPACK". With the CSS all images were styled as icons.-->
