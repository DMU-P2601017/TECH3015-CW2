    <p>“Ryan, Ryan.. What have you done again? You think you can blame it all on 
        your poor brother David? He’s the only one who’s been visiting you since you
         were admitted here,” said a big guy, holding keys from Ryan’s cell in his hand.
        “No, no.. you’re wrong. I don’t belong here! Let me out.”
        “You almost killed another people, this time you wanted to burn the house down?!”
        “I didn’t burn it down, cause I wanted all of you to see.. that he’s a monster!” screamed Ryan hopelessly.
        “We know that you’re the monster, you proved us again…”</p>
   <p>Ryan is a patient of the local psychiatric hospital, also known as Charleston Institute. 
    He suffers from schizophrenia, anxiety, and paranoid personality disorder.
    Ryan was imprisoned for his horrible actions and crimes into this asylum to manage 
    his mental illness. Ryan was trying many times to blame his strange behaviour which resulted in 
    kidnapping, killing, and experimenting on people on his brother David. David is the only member 
    of family that still visited him and gave him support. </p>
  <p>In reality it was Ryan who was torturing people before he was captured and placed in hospital, 
    where he has been now for 7 years.</p>
   <p> When Ryan decided to call the police, staff got enough time to put him to sleep and bring him back to the psychiatric 
    ward where he escaped from. Even after all those months of trying to improve his mental condition, Ryan got one of his episodes. 
    He managed to escape from his cell, mistakenly thought he’s about to solve the murder mystery he had done himself.
    He will be imprisoned here forever and maybe one day he will realise it all.
