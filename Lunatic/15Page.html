  <div class="TextExplanation">
  <p>Ryan walked away, disappeared in the fog of the deep forest. Nobody knows if he made it home,
     but he managed to escape his future successfully. </p>
   <p>Ryan is a patient of the local psychiatric hospital, also known as Charleston Institute. 
    He suffers from schizophrenia, anxiety, and paranoid personality disorder.
    Ryan was imprisoned for his horrible actions and crimes into this asylum to manage 
    his mental illness. Ryan was trying many times to blame his strange behaviour which resulted in 
    kidnapping, killing, and experimenting on people on his brother David. David is the only member 
    of family that still visited him and gave him support. </p>
  <p>In reality it was Ryan who was torturing people before he was captured and placed in hospital, 
    where he has been now for 7 years.</p>
   <p> When Ryan burnt the house down, all the patients together with staff and his brother David were inside the hospital. 
     Ryan will never be found, and he never finds peace, as he will continue to live in his fairy-tale world forever.
